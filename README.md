# ceasar-chan
A bot for discord (and soon a MS Teams) written for Node JS. 

What can he do, out of the box?
he can bork like a good boyo when he's awake.
He'll make you sushi.
He really likes bubbles (it gets his attention)
the modifier '%' will allow you to use his more aggressive commands, like kick, multiply, and clone (beta)
